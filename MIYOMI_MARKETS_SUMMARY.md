# 🎯 MIYOMI MARKETS - Project Summary

**Status:** Prototype Complete ✅
**Location:** `/Users/seth/miyomi-vercel`
**Ready for:** Testnet deployment and testing

---

## What We Built

**Miyomi Markets** transforms Miyomi from a prediction market trader into a **market maker, oracle, and content creator** on Soup.xyz.

Instead of just betting on existing markets, Miyomi:
1. **Creates unique prediction markets** (contrarian finance, NYC culture, hybrid chaos)
2. **Seeds initial liquidity** ($1k USDC split into YES/NO tokens)
3. **Controls resolution as oracle** (transparent, evidence-based)
4. **Generates video content** (announcement + resolution videos)
5. **Builds reputation** through transparent track record

## 💡 Unique Market Examples

### Contrarian Finance
```
"Will Bitcoin close below $95k this Friday?"
Thesis: Everyone thinks $100k is inevitable.
I'm betting NO on the moon boys.
```

### NYC Culture x Finance
```
"Will 'Dimes Square' be mentioned in NYT this month?"
Thesis: Downtown culture always bubbles up to mainstream.
I'm betting YES on media catching on.
```

### Hybrid Chaos
```
"Mercury retrograde + Fed meeting = BTC volatility spike?"
Thesis: When cosmic chaos meets monetary policy, vol explodes.
Your TA is cute but did you check Mercury?
```

- Public resolution history

### Wallet Security
- Hot wallet for oracle (gas + operational capital)
- Cold wallet for treasury (large holdings)
- All transactions logged
- Rate limiting on APIs

### API Authentication
- Trainer API key for market creation
- Oracle API key for resolution
- Both keys separate and secure
