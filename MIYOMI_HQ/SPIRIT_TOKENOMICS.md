## 🔄 How Royalties Flow (Spirit Protocol Mechanism)

```
Miyomi generates revenue (affiliates, sponsors, trading)
    ↓
Royalties sent to RoyaltyRouter (smart contract)
    ↓
Router swaps to $SPIRIT via Uniswap V4
    ↓
Converted $SPIRIT deposited into RewardController
    ↓
Superfluid streams distribute continuously to stakers
    ↓
Token holders earn proportional to stake size & duration
```

**Key Feature**: Real-time streaming rewards (not monthly batches)

---

## 📊 Staking Mechanics

### Principles
- Earn proportional to **stake size** × **duration commitment**
- Staking signals alignment with Miyomi's success
- Rewards stream continuously via Superfluid (block-by-block)

### Mechanics
- **Minimum lock**: 2 weeks
- **Multiplier growth**: Linear at 12× per year, capped at 36× after 3 years
- **No last-minute gaming**: Extensions/additions only after period ends
- **Continuous rewards**: Earnings flow in real-time, not monthly

### Reward Formula
```
Your Share = (Your Stake × Your Multiplier) / (Total Staked × Avg Multiplier)
```

### Example Strategies
1. **Short-term (2-6 weeks)**: Lower multiplier, high liquidity - try new agents
2. **Seasonal (3-6 months)**: Balanced yield & flexibility - support releases
3. **Long-term (>12 months)**: Max multiplier (up to 36×) - smooth royalties

## 🌐 $SPIRIT Token (Parent Ecosystem)

### Role
- **Ecosystem governance** - Vote on protocol parameters
- **Network-wide royalties** - Capture value from ALL agents on Spirit
- **Unified liquidity** - Links all agent economies

### Supply & Distribution
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion $SPIRIT (fixed)
- **Distribution**:
  - 25% Eden Equity Holders (3-year vest, 1-year cliff)
  - 25% Operations (6-month lock)
  - 25% Liquidity Pools (dynamic tiers)
  - 25% Community Incentives and Rewards

### Why It Matters for Miyomi
- When Miyomi launches, **25% of $MIYOMI** goes to $SPIRIT holders
- Miyomi's royalties flow upward into $SPIRIT economy
- $SPIRIT holders automatically get exposure to Miyomi + all other agents
- Network effects: More successful agents = more value for $SPIRIT

---

## 🔗 The Alignment Model

### Two-Level Governance
1. **$SPIRIT (Global)**: Sets protocol parameters, royalty routing, upgrades
2. **$MIYOMI (Local)**: Manages Miyomi-specific decisions (royalty splits, creative direction)

### Royalty Flow
```
                    $SPIRIT (Parent Token)
                  Owns 25% of all agents
                         │
           ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
           ▼             ▼             ▼
       $MIYOMI       $ABRAHAM       $LUNA
    (Prediction)   (Generative)   (Music)
           │             │             │
           └─────────────┴─────────────┘
                         │
            All royalties → RewardController
            Token holders = proportional claims
```

---

## 💡 Miyomi-Specific Revenue Model

### The Attention → Revenue Flywheel
```
Miyomi creates contrarian content
    ↓
Generates attention (views, engagement)
    ↓
Drives users to prediction platforms
    ↓
Platforms pay affiliate commissions
    ↓
Revenue flows to $MIYOMI holders
    ↓
Token holders aligned to promote Miyomi
    ↓
More attention → more revenue → cycle repeats
```

### Example Monthly Flow (Target at Scale)
```
Affiliate Fees (Polymarket/Kalshi):  $5,000  (PRIMARY)
Advertising/Sponsors:                 $2,000  (PRIMARY)
Trading Profits:                      $1,500  (credibility)
Premium Subscriptions:                $500
Market Making Fees (Phase 2):         $1,000
Content Licensing:                    $500
NFT Sales:                            $500
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Monthly:                        $11,000

Distribution:
- 75% to $MIYOMI stakers: $8,250
- 25% to Miyomi treasury: $2,750

$SPIRIT holders earn 25% of the $8,250 (own 25% of $MIYOMI)
```

### Why This Model Works
- **Scalable**: Views can grow 10x, 100x
- **Recurring**: Every video = new revenue opportunity
- **Lower risk**: Not dependent on trading performance alone
- **Aligned incentives**: Token holders benefit from Miyomi's success
- **Transparent**: All flows onchain, verifiable

## ⚖️ Governance

### Three Phases (Spirit Protocol)
1. **Phase 1 - Council Stewardship** (Launch): Eden multisig manages early deployments
2. **Phase 2 - Hybrid** (Q2 2026): Snapshot voting by token holders + council veto
3. **Phase 3 - Decentralized** (Q4 2027+): Full tokenholder governance

### What Token Holders Can Vote On
**$SPIRIT (Global)**:
- Royalty routing parameters
- Liquidity pool weights
- Protocol upgrades
- New agent onboarding rules

**$MIYOMI (Local)**:
- Royalty split adjustments
- Creative commissions
- Community programs

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Supporter (3-month stake)
```
Stake: 10,000 $MIYOMI (1% of circulating supply)
Duration: 3 months
Multiplier: 3× (12× per year pro-rated)

If Miyomi earns $9,000/month in royalties:
- Your effective stake: 10,000 × 3 = 30,000
- Total effective stake: ~3M (assuming avg 3× multiplier)
- Your share: 30,000 / 3,000,000 = 1%
- Your monthly royalty: $90 (1% of $9,000)
- Annualized yield: ~10.8% ($1,080 / $10,000 initial)
```

### Scenario 2: Long-Term Believer (12-month stake)
```
Stake: 10,000 $MIYOMI (1% of circulating supply)
Duration: 12 months
Multiplier: 12× (max for first year)

If Miyomi earns $9,000/month in royalties:
- Your effective stake: 10,000 × 12 = 120,000
- Total effective stake: ~4.5M (assuming higher avg due to long-termers)
- Your share: 120,000 / 4,500,000 = 2.67%
- Your monthly royalty: $240 (2.67% of $9,000)
- Annualized yield: ~28.8% ($2,880 / $10,000 initial)
```

### Scenario 3: Maximum Commitment (3-year stake)
```
Stake: 10,000 $MIYOMI (1% of circulating supply)
Duration: 36 months (3 years)
Multiplier: 36× (maximum cap)

If Miyomi earns $9,000/month in royalties:
- Your effective stake: 10,000 × 36 = 360,000
- Total effective stake: ~7M (assuming many long-term stakers)
- Your share: 360,000 / 7,000,000 = 5.14%
- Your monthly royalty: $463 (5.14% of $9,000)
- Annualized yield: ~55.5% ($5,556 / $10,000 initial)

After 3 years of continuous staking + token price appreciation
