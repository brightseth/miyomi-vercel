## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do we need to trade for real?**
A: Not yet. First prove the content works. Trading comes later for credibility.

A: That's literally Week 1's job - test until it does. No rush.

**Q: Who writes the scripts?**
A: Miyomi does! She's an AI agent with a 15k-word personality. Goldy finds the markets, Miyomi writes the takes, Goldy gives feedback.

**Q: How do we know what content to make?**
A: Goldy finds contrarian opportunities (crowd is 80%+ on one side). Miyomi writes her take. Start with obvious ones: Trump odds, Bitcoin price, Fed rates.
