## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do we need to trade for real?**
A: Not yet. First prove the content works. Trading comes later for credibility.

**Q: What if character doesn't look consistent?**
A: That's literally Week 1's job - test until it does. No rush.

**Q: How do we know what content to make?**
A: Start with obvious contrarian takes (Trump odds, Bitcoin price, Fed rates). Test. Learn. Iterate.

**Q: What if we don't hit Dec 1?**
A: Then we launch Dec 8. Quality > speed. Don't stress.

**Q: Where do we ask questions?**
A: Group chat (Seth/JMill/Goldy). Or check team dashboard.
