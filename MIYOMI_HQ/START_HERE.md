# START HERE - MIYOMI LAUNCH

**For: JMill (developer) + Goldy (growth)**

---

## 🎯 What Are We Building?

**MIYOMI** = AI influencer who makes contrarian prediction market bets on video

Think: Emma Chamberlain meets prediction markets

- **Character**: 22yo Asian-American NYC trader (edgy, cyberpunk vibes)
- **Content**: 30-second vertical videos with contrarian takes
- **Revenue**: Users click her affiliate links → sign up for Polymarket/Kalshi → we get paid
- **Launch**: Dec 1, 2025 (6 weeks from now)

---

## 💰 How It Makes Money

1. Miyomi posts video: "Everyone thinks Trump will win, but here's why they're wrong..."
2. Video goes viral on Twitter/Telegram
3. People click link in bio → sign up for Polymarket
4. Polymarket pays us $X per signup
5. Repeat daily

**That's it.** No complicated stuff.

---

## 🔄 Content Workflow (Training → Autonomous)

**Week 1-2 (Training Mode)**:
```
1. Goldy shows Miyomi how to find markets
2. Miyomi scans, suggests 5 opportunities
3. Goldy reviews: "Yes, no, yes, no, yes"
4. Miyomi learns what "contrarian" means
5. Repeat until she gets it
```

**Week 3+ (Autonomous Mode)**:
```
1. Miyomi scans markets herself (daily)
   ↓
2. Miyomi writes 30s script
   ↓
3. Miyomi generates video via Eden API
   ↓
4. Miyomi posts draft to Telegram "Degen" for feedback
   ↓
5. Goldy reviews (approve/reject/tweak)
   ↓
6. Seth final approval (first few videos only)
   ↓
7. Miyomi posts final video to Twitter + Telegram
   ↓
8. Miyomi tracks results, learns, improves
   ↓
9. JMill only helps if something breaks
```

**Key point**: Miyomi is autonomous. Goldy is the trainer, not the ghostwriter.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do we need to trade for real?**
A: Not yet. First prove the content works. Trading comes later for credibility.

**Q: What if character doesn't look consistent?**
A: That's literally Week 1's job - test until it does. No rush.

**Q: Who writes the scripts?**
A: Miyomi does! She's an AI agent with a 15k-word personality. She scans markets, writes scripts, generates videos, posts content. Goldy just trains and approves.

**Q: How do we know what content to make?**
A: Miyomi scans Polymarket daily, finds contrarian opportunities (crowd 80%+ on one side), writes her take. Goldy trained her what "contrarian" means.

**Q: Who actually posts the videos?**
A: Miyomi posts them herself via Twitter/Telegram API. JMill sets up the API access, then Miyomi runs autonomously.

**Q: What if we don't hit Dec 1?**
A: Then we launch Dec 8. Quality > speed. Don't stress.

**Q: Where do we ask questions?**
A: Group chat (Seth/JMill/Goldy). Or check team dashboard.
