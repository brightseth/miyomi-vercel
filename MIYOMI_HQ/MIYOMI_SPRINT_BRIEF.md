# MIYOMI SPRINT BRIEF - 2 Week Launch Plan

**Status**: Post-jmill meeting, ready to execute
**Timeline**: Oct 20 - Nov 1 (soft launch)
**Owner**: Seth (PM), JMill (daily driver), Jacob (growth/hooks)

---

## 🎯 Core Thesis

Build **Miyomi** as AI prediction-market influencer:
- **Format**: Daily 30-45s vertical video + X/Twitter posts + Telegram
- **Revenue**: Affiliate deals (Polymarket first) → sponsored weeks → private signals
- **Edge**: Speed to culture + entertainment value (not quant outperformance)
- **Distribution**: Twitter (media) + Telegram (announcements + open Degen + private Signals Pro)

---

## 🎬 Workflow (Human-in-Loop)

```
Signal Finder → Top 5 topics (10am, 4pm CET)
    ↓
Human Trainer picks 1 topic (Jacob/JMill/Seth)
    ↓
Auto-generate script + video
    ↓
Seth approves (same-day)
    ↓
Publish: Twitter + Telegram
    ↓
Track: UTMs → clicks → conversions
```

**Note**: Human curation is FINE. Don't oversell autonomy.

---

## 📊 Metrics That Matter (Weekly)

### Output
- Videos/day, on-time rate

### Distribution
- Views, avg watch time, engagement rate

### Funnel
- CTR on links, signups, affiliate conversions, CAC/CPA

### Community
- Telegram growth, active posters, retention

### Topic Hit Rate
- % posts on rising threads within 30 min

---

## 🗓️ Milestones

- **Soft Launch**: End of Week 2 (Sat Nov 1)
- **Sponsor Week #1**: Mid-Nov (post-election/holiday retail)

## 🚨 Risks & Counters

| Risk | Counter |
|------|---------|
| Character drift | Model lock + recipe versioning; reject until within tolerance |
| Platform throttling | Blend public scraping + manual lists; no auto-reply bots |
| Low conversion | One sponsor first; iterate CTA placement; show proof-case |
| Team distraction (Abraham) | Firewall Henry to protocol; keep execution with JMill/Jacob |

## 🚫 What We Decided NOT To Do

- ❌ Farcaster (wrong audience)
- ❌ Full chat UI on miyomi.ai (teaser only)
- ❌ Oversell autonomy (human-in-loop is fine)
- ❌ Build on Abraham timeline (move independently)
- ❌ Get stuck in Henry/Jean front-end politics

---

## 💰 Revenue Model

1. **Affiliate** (first): Polymarket → Kalshi/DraftKings/Robinhood
2. **Sponsored weeks**: Mid-Nov after proof-case
3. **Private signals**: $X/month after traction (100 beta, then scale)

---

## 🎨 Character Consistency (Critical)

- Lock a look/voice immediately
- If Eden tools aren't enough, use best-in-class off-platform
- Bring learnings back to Eden
- No drift allowed - reject until within tolerance

---

## 📈 Scale Target

**By End Q1 2026**:
- 5 agents shipped (target by EOY)
- 10 agents by end Q1
- 10k Telegram (open) + 1k Signals Pro
- Unit economics proven

---

**Status**: Ready to execute. Start daily stand-ups tomorrow (Oct 18).

**Next Review**: End of Week 1 (Fri Oct 24) - assess KPIs, adjust Week 2.

Let's ship this! 🚀
