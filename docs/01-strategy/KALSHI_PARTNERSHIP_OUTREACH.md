## 🎯 Outreach Strategy

### Why Kalshi Priority

From A16Z_PREDICTION_MARKETS_STRATEGY.md:
- a16z co-led Kalshi Series D (announced with prediction markets article)
- Regulated prediction markets = massive TAM
- MIYOMI + Kalshi = perfect timing for partnership
- Potential for formal affiliate/integration deal

### MIYOMI Value Proposition for Kalshi

**What Miyomi Brings:**
1. **Personality-driven user acquisition** - The "influencer funnel" for prediction markets
2. **Education** - Teaching people how to think about markets (raises overall engagement)
3. **Content engine** - 3+ videos per week driving traffic
4. **Contrarian positioning** - Makes markets more interesting/debatable
5. **Cultural relevance** - "Prediction movement" positioning aligns with a16z thesis

**What Kalshi Needs:**
- User acquisition (regulated markets need volume)
- Brand awareness (compete with Polymarket, PredictIt)

## 📧 Email Draft v1: Direct Outreach

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: MIYOMI x Kalshi - AI Personality for Prediction Markets

**To:** partnerships@kalshi.com (or specific contact if found)

**Body:**

Hi Kalshi team,

I'm Seth Goldstein, creator of **MIYOMI** - an AI personality teaching prediction mastery through contrarian trading in prediction markets.

**What is MIYOMI:**
- AI influencer focused on prediction markets (think Maria Bartiromo meets prediction markets)
- Takes public contrarian positions on markets with extreme consensus (>75% or <25%)
- Creates 3+ educational videos per week explaining contrarian thesis
- Building audience as "the personality" for the prediction movement
- Part of Eden Spirit Protocol (tokenized AI artists with real revenue)

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**

I noticed a16z co-led your Series D and published Alex Danco's piece on prediction as "the successor to postmodernism." This perfectly aligns with what we're building with MIYOMI.

We're launching in mid-December 2025 (building track record now through Nov) and want Kalshi to be a priority integration partner.

**What a Partnership Could Look Like:**

1. **Affiliate Program**
   - MIYOMI drives signups to Kalshi via videos/content
   - Standard affiliate commission per qualified signup
   - Attribution tracking via custom links

2. **Featured Markets**
   - MIYOMI focuses content on Kalshi's economic indicator markets
   - Brings attention to less-traded contracts
   - Educates audience on how to use Kalshi

3. **Co-Branded Content**
   - "MIYOMI's Kalshi Picks of the Week"
   - Educational series: "How to Trade Economic Events"
   - Joint promotion across channels

4. **API Integration**
   - Direct Kalshi market data in MIYOMI dashboard
   - One-click trade execution from MIYOMI.ai
   - Public P&L tracking for credibility

**Current Traction:**

We're in Phase 1 (building track record):
- Database & infrastructure: 75% complete
- Target: 20+ trades, 65%+ win rate by December
- Focus: Economic indicators, cultural events, crypto markets
- Launch: Mid-December 2025 with $MIYOMI token

**Why This Timing:**

The a16z article validates what we're building - prediction markets need personalities, not just platforms. MIYOMI is positioned to be THE personality for this movement, and Kalshi is the ideal platform (regulated, serious, economic focus).

Would love to discuss how we can work together. Happy to share more details, demo the platform, or jump on a call.

Best,
Seth Goldstein
