# Prediction Path Screenshot Format

**New Miyomi Content Format: Prediction as Art**

Based on a16z insights about prediction markets becoming cultural artifacts and "public predictions as pop art."

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Prediction Path Screenshots** = Document the entire prediction journey, not just the result.

Make both wins AND losses into interesting art. The journey is the product.

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Visual Style
- **Black background**, white/green text (Miyomi brand colors)
- **Helvetica bold** for headers
- **Screenshots** of actual market data (authenticity)
- **Miyomi portrait** in execution panel (personality)
- **Clean typography** - Swiss design principles

### Emotional Arc
1. **Setup**: "Look at this extreme"
2. **Execution**: "Here's why I disagree" (tension)
3. **Resolution**: "Here's what happened" (payoff)

### Make Losses Interesting Too
```
LOSS EXAMPLE:

Panel 1: "73% think Fed won't hike"
Panel 2: "I took YES because..."
Panel 3: "Fed didn't hike. I was wrong. Here's what I learned..."

→ Losses show authenticity, process > outcome
→ "Even contrarians get it wrong. The lesson matters."
```

---

## 📱 Platform Variations

### Twitter/X Format
- **Single image**: Vertical 3-panel triptych
- **Caption**: Brief hook + link
- Example: "Oct 2025: I called Bitcoin wouldn't hit $100k when 87% said yes. Here's the journey 🧵"

### Farcaster Format
- **Cast 1**: Setup image + context
- **Cast 2**: Execution image + thesis
- **Cast 3**: Resolution image + lesson
- Thread format with engagement at each step

### Instagram Format
- **Carousel**: Swipe through 3 panels
- **Story highlight**: "Prediction Journeys"
- More visual, less text

### Long-Form (Blog/Newsletter)
- Expand each panel into full section
- Add detailed analysis
- Include market context, technical indicators
- "Behind the prediction" deep dive

---

## 🎯 Content Goals

### Viral Potential
- **Shareable format**: Clean, recognizable structure
- **Emotional payoff**: Journey creates engagement
- **Both outcomes work**: Wins AND losses are interesting
- **Meme-able**: "Miyomi called it when everyone said..."

### Educational Value
- **Shows thinking process**: Not just picks
- **Teaches prediction mastery**: How to be upstream
- **Demonstrates contrarian approach**: When to fade consensus
- **Transparent**: Real trades, real results

### Brand Building
- **Recognizable format**: "Oh, another Miyomi Prediction Path"
- **Consistent quality**: Professional design every time
- **Personality integration**: Miyomi's voice throughout
- **Cultural artifacts**: Each prediction is a collectible moment

## 💡 Why This Works

### From a16z Article Insights

**"Prediction contracts as the new patents"**
→ Each path is a public contribution to collective knowledge

**"Public predictions as pop art"**
→ The format IS the art, not just the content

**"How early or late you are is now essential"**
→ Documenting the journey shows you were upstream

**"I want to feel something, even if it hurts"**
→ Real stakes, real emotion, real lessons

### Miyomi Advantage
- **Contrarian = inherently interesting** (tension built-in)
- **Public P&L = authenticity** (real skin in game)
- **Journey > result** (process is the product)
- **Both outcomes work** (losses are instructive art)
