## 💡 Key Insights

### What's Working Well:
1. **Documentation is comprehensive** - Clear vision and roadmap
2. **Core libraries built** - Polymarket, Kalshi, Soup.xyz integrations ready
3. **Team aligned** - Seth creative, jmill tooling
4. **Revenue model clear** - Attention → leads/ads is primary
5. **Timeline realistic** - Mid-December is achievable

### What Needs Focus:
1. **Video pipeline** - Critical path, needs jmill's expertise
2. **Database setup** - Foundation for everything else
3. **First content** - Need to test and iterate quickly
4. **Affiliate deals** - Secure partnerships early
5. **Execution cadence** - Need to ship consistently

### Biggest Risks:
1. **Video quality/consistency** - Yeah LoRA must work well
2. **Time to mid-December** - Only 10 weeks, need to move fast
3. **Affiliate partnerships** - May take time to negotiate
4. **Audience building** - 1,000 followers in 10 weeks is aggressive
5. **Win rate pressure** - Need 65%+ for token launch

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Start video testing immediately** - Don't wait
2. **Weekly sprints** - Ship something every week
3. **Parallel work** - Seth + jmill work independently where possible
4. **Lower quality bar initially** - Iterate quickly, perfect later
5. **Focus on attention first** - Revenue will follow eyeballs
