## What's Working Now

### 1. Video Generation Pipeline âœ…
**Complete production system:**
- **Video:** Eden API with Kling model (2-5 min)
- **Voiceover:** ElevenLabs TTS (20-30 sec)
- **Combination:** FFmpeg merge (5-10 sec)
- **Total:** 3-6 minutes per complete video

**Visual Style:**
- Yeah LoRA for consistent Miyomi character
- 9:16 vertical format for TikTok/Shorts
- Pink/cyan neon cyberpunk aesthetic
- NYC rooftop/trading floor backgrounds
- Glitchy, stylized, non-photorealistic

### 2. Daily Workflow Ready
**Morning (9am):**

- Generate professional voiceover
- Combine into viral-ready content

**Afternoon (2pm):**

### 3. Content Strategy

**Core Philosophy:**
"Education disguised as entertainment, delivered with conviction that makes you want to check your portfolio immediately."

**Miyomi doesn't say:** "I'm betting NO on this"
**Miyomi says:** "Everyone thinks Bitcoin hits $100k... here's why the crowd might be wrong. 64% probability they're overconfident. Check Polymarket."

**Her voice:**
- Confident but probabilistic ("64% chance" not "definitely")
- Data-driven but culturally aware (charts meet memes)
- "Markets whisper..." not "I'm trading..."
- Oracle energy, not trader energy
- Vulnerable moments (shows losses for authenticity)

**Content Creation Process (Daily):**
1. **Market Scanning (8am)** - Reviews 50+ markets, identifies 3-5 potentials
2. **Data Deep Dive (9am)** - Researches supporting evidence, builds conviction
3. **Narrative Hook (10am)** - Finds angle that makes complex analysis accessible
4. **Script & Shoot (11am)** - One-take recordings with minimal editing (authenticity > perfection)
5. **Distribution (12pm sharp)** - Daily pick goes live across all platforms simultaneously
