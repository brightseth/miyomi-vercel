## Primary Revenue Model (Clarified)

### Phase 1: Attention â†’ Leads/Advertising (Now - Q1 2026)

**The Model:**
Miyomi generates attention through contrarian takes and personality. We monetize that attention by driving traffic to prediction market platforms.

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Affiliate/referral fees** - Polymarket & Kalshi signups from videos
2. **Advertising deals** - Sponsored content, brand integrations
3. **Lead generation** - Drive users to platforms we partner with
4. **Trading profits** - Secondary (proves credibility, not primary revenue)

**Why This Works:**
- Prediction markets are growing fast (election cycles, crypto, macro)
- Platforms NEED users and are willing to pay for acquisition
- Miyomi's personality makes people want to try prediction markets
- Every video = lead generation funnel
- Scale is unlimited (views â†’ signups â†’ revenue)

**Example:**
```
Miyomi video: "Everyone thinks Bitcoin hits $100k? I'm fading..."
â†’ 10,000 views
â†’ 200 click affiliate link
â†’ 50 sign up to Polymarket
â†’ $25/signup = $1,250 revenue
â†’ Flows to $MIYOMI holders
```

### Phase 2: Create Own Markets (Q1 2026+)

**When Soup.xyz launches:**
- Miyomi creates her own markets
- Earns market making fees
- Acts as oracle (resolves outcomes)
- Adds to revenue, doesn't replace Phase 1

**Combined Model:**
```
Attention â†’ Leads/Ads â†’ $5k/month
Trading Profits â†’ $2k/month
Market Making (Soup.xyz) â†’ $2k/month
Subscriptions/NFTs â†’ $1k/month
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total: $10k/month â†’ Token holders
```

## Revenue Focus: Attention Economy

**The Insight:**
Prediction markets are HOT right now (elections, crypto, macro events). Platforms are spending heavily on user acquisition. Miyomi can be the personality that drives users to these platforms.

**The Funnel:**
```
Contrarian Video (personality)
    â†“
Viewer Engagement (views, shares)
    â†“
Click Affiliate Link (Polymarket/Kalshi)
    â†“
Sign Up (platforms pay for this)
    â†“
Revenue â†’ $MIYOMI Token Holders
```

**Why Affiliates/Ads > Trading Profits:**
- **Scalable:** Views can grow 10x, 100x
- **Recurring:** Every video = new revenue
- **Predictable:** CPM/CPA models are standard
- **Lower risk:** Don't need to win trades to earn
- **Alignment:** Platforms WANT to be promoted

**Trading is for credibility:**
- Proves Miyomi knows what she's talking about
- 65%+ win rate = trust
- Transparent P&L = authenticity
- But revenue comes from driving traffic

### Polymarket
- Affiliate program (likely $10-50 per signup)
