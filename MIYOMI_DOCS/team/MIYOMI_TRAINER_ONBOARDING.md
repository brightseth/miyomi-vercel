**For:** Trainer (Prediction Market Expert)
**From:** Founder
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Ready to launch

---

## TL;DR - The Opportunity

**You're the Trainer for Miyomi - a prediction market oracle launching on Spirit Protocol.**

**Time commitment:** 15-30 min/day
**Compensation:** 75M $MIYOMI tokens (30% of team allocation)
**Timeline:** 10 weeks to token launch (Dec 16, 2025)
**Your edge:** Your Polymarket + prediction market expertise is THE critical asset

---

## Who Is Miyomi?

**Miyomi = 22-year-old prediction market oracle who creates viral content about contrarian opportunities.**

She's NOT a trader executing positions. She's an **oracle/influencer** (think Maria Bartiromo meets Gen-Z prediction markets) who:
- Highlights interesting contrarian market opportunities
- Creates 30-60 sec TikTok videos with "Markets whisper..." mystique
- Builds audience through prediction accuracy + personality
- Revenue from attention (affiliate links + subscriptions), not trading P&L

**Her voice:**
- Fast-talking NYC energy (ESTP personality)
- Gen-Z slang mixed with probabilistic analysis
- "Markets whisper to those who listen..." catchphrase
- Contrarian but not cynical - confident but not arrogant

**Core thesis:** "The crowd is always wrong at extremes"
- Identifies markets with >70% or <30% consensus
- Highlights asymmetric risk/reward opportunities
- Tracks accuracy publicly (target: 65%+ correct)

---

**Review AI-generated market brief**
- AI scans Polymarket/Kalshi overnight
- Presents 3 contrarian opportunities
- You select the most interesting one
- Edit script if needed (AI does first draft)

**Your expertise:**
- You know which markets actually get volume
- You understand crowd psychology vs reality
- You can spot truly high-quality opportunities
- You validate AI suggestions with real market knowledge

### Midday (11:00 AM - 10 min)
**Approve and post video**

- Approve or request regeneration
- Post to TikTok with affiliate link
- Cross-post to Twitter/Farcaster

**Your quality control:**
- Ensure Miyomi's voice stays authentic
- Verify market data is accurate

## How You Get Paid

### Token Allocation: 75M $MIYOMI (30% of team)

**Team split:**
```
$MIYOMI Token (1 billion total supply):
├─ 25% → $SPIRIT holders (Spirit Protocol graduation)
├─ 25% → Liquidity pool
├─ 25% → Team (250M tokens):
│        ├─ 40% Founder (100M) - Vision, IP, strategy
│        ├─ 30% Dev (75M) - Technical platform
│        └─ 30% Trainer (75M) - Daily ops + PM expertise ← YOU
└─ 25% → Miyomi treasury (agent allocation)
```

**Why 30% (equal to Dev)?**
- Your Polymarket/Novig expertise = as valuable as building the platform
- Daily operational commitment = ongoing value creation
- Content curation = where the magic happens
- Team recognizes specialized prediction market knowledge as critical

### How Royalties Work (Spirit Protocol)

**All Miyomi revenue flows through Spirit Protocol:**
1. Revenue (affiliates, subs, etc.) → RevenueRouter
2. Swapped to $SPIRIT via Uniswap
3. Distributed weekly via Superfluid Money Streaming
4. To pledgers of $MIYOMI token

**Your tokens auto-pledged 12 months:**
- Locked = can't sell for 12 months
- Benefit = 12× royalty multiplier
- You earn 76-83% of revenue initially (team's weighted share)
- After 12 months: Re-pledge for 24×-36× multiplier OR sell

**Example financial projection (Month 18):**
```
Miyomi revenue: $3,000/month
Team share (weighted): 76.9%
Team royalty income: $2,307/month

Your share (30%): $692/month
Plus: Token appreciation if Miyomi succeeds
Plus: Optional trainer fee ($1k-2k/mo from treasury once revenue permits)
```

- **Token-aligned** incentives (everyone wins together)

### Competitive Advantages

- Momentum exhaustion signals
- No one else has this data publicly

**2. Soup.xyz Market Creation** (unique)
- Create custom markets
- Control resolution as oracle
- Market-making revenue potential
- Platform independence

**3. Your Expertise** (critical)
- Real PM trading experience
- Industry insider knowledge
- Content creation skills
- Credibility and network

**4. Spirit Protocol** (legitimacy)
- Professional token infrastructure
- Automatic $SPIRIT holder distribution
- Graduation path to autonomy
- Regulatory-conscious design

## Risks & Considerations

### Time Commitment
- **Sustainable?** 15-30 min/day for 10 weeks
- **Daily requirement:** Can't skip days without notice
- **Flexibility:** Morning + midday + afternoon windows

**Mitigation:** Workflow designed for efficiency, AI does heavy lifting

### Revenue Uncertainty
- **Affiliate model:** Unproven until we test
- **Token value:** Depends on Miyomi's success
- **Timeline:** 12-month lock period

**Mitigation:** Multiple revenue streams planned, tokens = upside not only income

### Platform Risk
- **TikTok:** Account restrictions, algorithm changes
- **Polymarket:** Platform changes, affiliate program terms
- **Spirit Protocol:** Dependent on Eden ecosystem

**Mitigation:** Multi-platform strategy, diversified integrations

### Performance Pressure
- **Accuracy target:** 65%+ correct predictions
- **Growth target:** 1,000 followers in 10 weeks
- **Community:** Need to engage authentically

**Mitigation:** AI support, team collaboration, realistic targets

## Open Questions for Discussion

### Compensation
1. Token-only or token + monthly fee?
   - Proposal: $1k-2k/mo once Miyomi generates $2k+ sustained
   - Start date: When revenue permits
2. Performance bonuses tied to what metrics?
   - Proposal: 10% of revenue growth above $5k/mo

### Social Media
1. Create new accounts or use existing?
   - TikTok: @miyomi_oracle or @miyomimarkets?
2. Cross-promote through your channels?
   - Keep separate or integrate?

### Workflow
1. Async-only or prefer quick calls?
2. Best times for daily workflow?
   - Morning brief: 9 AM Pacific work?
3. Weekend coverage or weekdays only?

### Legal
1. Any disclaimers needed?
   - "Not financial advice" standard?
2. What jurisdiction applies?
   - Miyomi "lives" in NYC but virtual
3. Prediction market regulatory concerns?
