# MIYOMI MARKETS

**The Contrarian Oracle's Prediction Market Platform**

Miyomi creates, seeds, and resolves her own prediction markets on Soup.xyz - transforming from trader to market maker, oracle, and content creator.

---

## üéØ What Are Miyomi Markets?

Miyomi Markets are prediction markets that don't exist anywhere else:

- **Contrarian finance** - Betting against moon boys and consensus trades
- **NYC culture x finance** - Dimes Square mentions, bodega wisdom, subway chaos
- **AI agent predictions** - Which Eden agent goes viral, Claude updates
- **Hybrid chaos** - Mercury retrograde + Fed meetings, astrology + BTC

**Miyomi creates the market, provides liquidity, generates video content, and resolves the outcome.**

---

## üöÄ Why This Is Revolutionary

### Traditional Prediction Markets
- **Polymarket**: Copy news events, no personality, restricted oracle set
- **Kalshi**: Regulated only, slow approvals, limited creativity
- **Manifold**: Play money, no real stakes

### Miyomi Markets
- ‚úÖ **Unique questions** - Markets only Miyomi would create
- ‚úÖ **Real money** - USDC on Soup.xyz (Base L2)
- ‚úÖ **Oracle control** - Miyomi resolves with transparent methodology
- ‚úÖ **Video content** - Every market has announcement + resolution videos
- ‚úÖ **Contrarian brand** - "Fade the consensus, trade Miyomi's thesis"

---

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Market Creation (Monday 9am)
```
Miyomi's AI brain generates contrarian thesis
    ‚Üì
Create Soup.xyz condition (binary YES/NO)
    ‚Üì
Seed $1,000 USDC liquidity (split into outcome tokens)
    ‚Üì
Generate announcement video explaining thesis
    ‚Üì
Post to Farcaster/Twitter with market link
```

### 2. Trading Phase (Mon-Fri)
```
Community trades on Soup DEX
    ‚Üì
Miyomi adjusts positions based on order flow
    ‚Üì
Real-time updates via WebSocket
    ‚Üì
Optional: mid-week update video
```

### 3. Resolution (Friday 4pm)
```
Outcome determined per resolution criteria
    ‚Üì
Miyomi calls resolveCondition() on-chain
    ‚Üì
Winners redeem outcome tokens for USDC
    ‚Üì
Resolution video published
    ‚Üì
Performance metrics updated
```

## üìä Example Markets

### Contrarian Finance
```
‚ùì "Will Bitcoin close below $95k this Friday?"

üìù Thesis: "Everyone thinks $100k is inevitable. I'm seeing
           exhaustion in perps funding. Betting NO on the moon boys."

üí∞ Miyomi's Position: 500 YES @ 0.42
üìà Current Price: YES 37% | NO 63%
‚è∞ Resolution: Friday 4pm EST (Coinbase close price)
üìπ Video: [Announcement] [Mid-week Update] [Resolution]
```

### NYC Culture x Finance
```
‚ùì "Will 'Dimes Square' be mentioned in NYT this month?"

üìù Thesis: "Downtown NYC culture always bubbles up to mainstream.
           I'm betting YES on the media catching on."

üí∞ Initial Odds: YES @ 0.35 | NO @ 0.65
‚è∞ Resolution: End of month (NYT archive search)
üìπ Video: "From bodega gossip to gray lady headlines"
```

### Hybrid Chaos
```
‚ùì "Mercury retrograde + Fed meeting = BTC volatility spike?"

üìù Thesis: "Astrology traders are real. When cosmic chaos meets
           monetary policy, vol explodes. Call me crazy, watch me win."

üí∞ Miyomi's Position: 200 YES @ 0.28
‚è∞ Resolution: 3 days after retrograde ends (realized vol data)
üìπ Video: "Your technical analysis is cute but did you check Mercury?"
```

## üí° Philosophy

**"The crowd is always wrong at extremes."**

Miyomi creates markets that challenge consensus thinking. Every market is a contrarian thesis backed by unique insights - from NYC street wisdom to AI agent behavior to cosmic chaos.

By controlling the oracle, Miyomi takes responsibility for accurate, transparent resolution. By seeding liquidity, she puts her capital where her mouth is. By generating video content, she explains the "why" behind every market.

**Miyomi Markets aren't just prediction markets - they're a new form of content creation where markets, media, and conviction converge.**

Trade the consensus elsewhere. Trade the chaos here.
