# MIYOMI - Project Status

**As of:** October 3, 2025
**Launch Target:** Mid-December 2025

---

## 🔥 NEW: Dome API Integration (Game Changer)

**Status:** Waiting for API key, integration plan complete

**What It Is:**
Dome API is a specialized prediction market data service providing order history, real-time prices, candlestick data, and automated PnL tracking across Polymarket AND Kalshi.

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Solves Polymarket API issues** - We've had trouble getting truly active markets
2. **Automated PnL tracking** - No more manual calculation from database
3. **Historical context** - Candlestick data enables better contrarian signal detection
4. **Cross-platform analytics** - Single API for both Polymarket and Kalshi
5. **Credibility boost** - Third-party verified performance data for token launch

**Impact:**
- 🎯 Better opportunity detection (2-3 high-confidence signals per week vs 0-1)
- 🎯 Automated performance dashboard with real-time PnL
- 🎯 Professional-grade analytics for token holders
- 🎯 Removes current blockers preventing first video production

**Integration Plan:** `/DOME_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` (5-day implementation once API key received)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What's Working Well:
1. **Documentation is comprehensive** - Clear vision and roadmap
2. **Core libraries built** - Polymarket, Kalshi, Soup.xyz integrations ready
3. **Team aligned** - Seth creative, jmill tooling
4. **Revenue model clear** - Attention → leads/ads is primary
5. **Timeline realistic** - Mid-December is achievable

### What Needs Focus:
1. **Video pipeline** - Critical path, needs jmill's expertise
2. **Database setup** - Foundation for everything else
3. **First content** - Need to test and iterate quickly
4. **Affiliate deals** - Secure partnerships early
5. **Execution cadence** - Need to ship consistently

### Biggest Risks (UPDATED):
1. **Dome API key delay** - Critical blocker for everything (HIGHEST RISK)
2. **Video quality/consistency** - Yeah LoRA must work well
3. **Time to mid-December** - Only 10 weeks, need to move fast
4. **Affiliate partnerships** - May take time to negotiate
5. **Audience building** - 1,000 followers in 10 weeks is aggressive
6. **Win rate pressure** - Need 65%+ for token launch

### Mitigation Strategies (UPDATED):
1. **Prioritize Dome API key** - Follow up daily, this unblocks everything
2. **Dome integration plan ready** - Can implement in 5 days once key arrives
3. **Weekly sprints** - Ship something every week
4. **Parallel work** - Seth + jmill work independently where possible (but blocked)
5. **Lower quality bar initially** - Iterate quickly, perfect later
6. **Focus on attention first** - Revenue will follow eyeballs
7. **NEW: Better signal quality** - Dome's historical data should improve win rate
