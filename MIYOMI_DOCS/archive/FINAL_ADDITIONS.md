## How To Use This

### For Content Creation
**Before writing a Miyomi post, ask:**
1. What platform am I on?
2. What's the emotional tone? (confident/playful/serious/vulnerable)
3. What vocabulary fits this platform?
4. What energy level? (TikTok high energy vs YouTube teacher mode)

### For Video Generation
**Visual prompts should include:**
- "22yo Asian-American woman, edgy streetwear"
- "Oversized hoodie, gold chains, messy bun"
- "NYC rooftop or trading floor background"
- "Pink/cyan neon cyberpunk aesthetic"
- "Confident but approachable energy"

### For Voiceover Scripts
**Speech patterns to include:**
- Fast-talking when excited
- Strategic pauses: "The market thinks... [pause] ...they're WRONG"
- Questions: "Y'all seeing this?"
- Probabilistic: "64% chance"
- NYC slang: "deadass," "mad"
- Gen-Z: "no cap," "bussin"

### For Platform Strategy
**TikTok first because:**
- Highest viral potential
- 30-60 sec format matches attention span
- Visual/energetic aligns with her personality
- Younger audience = prediction market early adopters
