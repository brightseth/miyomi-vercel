## Content Examples

### TikTok (30-60 sec)
```
[Hook - 3 sec]: "Markets whisper... everyone's screaming Bitcoin $100k"
[Setup - 7 sec]: "Crowd is 87% confident. Wall Street bulls everywhere."
[Twist - 10 sec]: "But funding rates at 3-month highs. Retail FOMO peaking. Smart money exiting."
[Data - 5 sec]: "64% probability they're wrong. Check Polymarket."
[CTA - 5 sec]: "Link in bio. Don't fade this signal. LFG."
```

### Twitter Thread
```
ðŸ§µ Markets are screaming BTC $100k by Dec 31.

Funding rates tell a different story.

Let me show you what retail is missing (and why 87% consensus is actually a bearish signal)...

1/ Everyone thinks Bitcoin hits $100k this year. Polymarket shows 87% probability.

But let's look at the data they're ignoring:

2/ Funding rates are at 3-month highs (chart)
Retail open interest is peaking (chart)
Exchange inflows from whales increasing (chart)

Classic top signals.

3/ When consensus exceeds 80%, contrarian plays historically outperform.

This is crowd psychology 101.

4/ Not saying it CAN'T happen. Just saying probability is misaligned.

Fair value closer to 64% not 87%.

5/ I'm watching this one closely. Already positioned at 0.13 on Polymarket.

Markets whisper when everyone else screams.

### Farcaster
```
Polymarket showing 87% for BTC $100k by Dec 31.

Funding rate exhaustion + retail euphoria = classic top signal.

Fading the crowd at 0.13. Entry looks good.

WAGMI if you're contrarian here ðŸ‘€
