## ü§î Key Decisions Needed

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Video storage:** Supabase or Cloudflare R2?
2. **FFmpeg location:** Server-side where? (Vercel function, separate worker?)
3. **Social accounts:** Create official Miyomi accounts?
4. **Trade size:** How much capital per trade to start?

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Voice:** Stick with Rachel or try voice cloning?
2. **Video length:** Keep 10s or expand to 30s?
3. **Platforms:** Just Farcaster/Twitter or add TikTok?
4. **Community:** Discord, Telegram, or both?

### Medium-term (Month 2)
1. **Lip sync:** Worth the effort or ship without?
2. **Multiple traders:** Add other personas or keep Miyomi solo?
3. **API access:** Give followers API to follow trades?
4. **Institutional:** Target bigger traders or stay retail?
