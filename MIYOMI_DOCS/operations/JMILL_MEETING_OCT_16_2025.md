## üõ§Ô∏è Three Approaches (Choose One)

### Option A: Full Stack (Ambitious)
**Timeline:** 2 weeks, high intensity
**Seth + jmill both working full-time**

#### Week 1: Foundation
- **Days 1-2:** UI redesign (Seth: design, jmill: implementation)
- **Days 3-4:** Live data integration (jmill: APIs, Seth: testing)
- **Days 5-7:** Trainer workflow (jmill: backend, Seth: UX)

- **Days 12-14:** Launch (Seth: first trade, jmill: deployment)

**Pros:**
- Everything ready by Oct 29
- Complete system, professional quality
- Can start producing content immediately

**Cons:**
- Requires significant jmill time commitment
- High pressure, little room for delays
- Risk if either person gets blocked

**Best For:** If jmill can dedicate 20-30 hours this week

---

### Option B: Phased Launch (Realistic)
**Timeline:** 2 weeks to MVP, 2 more weeks to polish
**Seth + jmill working part-time**

#### Week 1: Core Functionality
- **Seth:** UI mockups, market research, content planning
- **jmill:** Market scanner API, Dome integration, database updates
- **Together:** Test market scanner with real data

#### Week 2: Video Pipeline
- **Seth:** Select first market, write thesis/script
- **jmill:** Eden API testing, video generation
- **Together:** End-to-end test with one real video

#### Week 3-4: Polish & Scale
- Refine based on learnings
- Build out remaining features
- Launch with 3-5 videos ready

**Pros:**
- More manageable pace
- Time to iterate and improve
- Less pressure, higher quality

**Cons:**
- Beta launch delayed to mid-November
- Token launch might slip to late December
- Momentum could slow

**Best For:** If jmill can dedicate 10-15 hours/week

---

### Option C: Minimum Viable Beta (Pragmatic)
**Timeline:** 1 week to bare minimum, iterate from there
**Focus on one complete workflow, everything else manual**

#### This Week (Oct 16-22):
1. **Market Scanner** (jmill: 4-6 hours)
   - Single endpoint: fetch top 50 Polymarket markets
   - Basic filtering (volume, consensus)
   - Display in simple HTML table

2. **Dome Dashboard** (jmill: 2-3 hours)
   - Connect existing `/api/dome/pnl` to index.html
   - Replace mock stats with real data
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

3. **Manual Video Pipeline** (Seth + jmill: 3-4 hours)
   - Seth: Select market, write script manually
   - jmill: Test Eden API with one video
   - Manual posting to social media

#### Next Week (Oct 23-29):
1. Execute first real trade
2. Generate video
3. Post and track engagement
4. Iterate based on results

**Pros:**
- Fastest path to testing real workflow
- Minimal jmill time needed (~10 hours total)
- Learn what actually matters vs nice-to-have
- Can iterate quickly

**Cons:**
- Lots of manual work initially
- Not as "wow" for demo purposes
- Automation comes later

**Best For:** If jmill can only dedicate 5-10 hours/week

- Testing and feedback loop
- Partnership outreach (Kalshi, platforms)
- Token launch preparation

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Review and approve UI mockups (with Goldy input)
- [ ] Test all features as they're built
- [ ] Coordinate between Goldy's market insights and jmill's implementation
- [ ] Set up social media accounts
- [ ] Execute first trade manually
- [ ] Oversee beta launch

### Goldy/Jacob (Domain Expert & Trainer)
**Focus:** Prediction market expertise, content strategy, market selection
**Time Commitment:** 5-10 hours/week

**Responsibilities:**
- **Market Selection** - Identify best contrarian opportunities
- **Market Dynamics** - Explain why consensus is wrong

- [ ] Help define "what good looks like" for market selection

**Why Goldy is Critical:**
- Seth + jmill can build the system, but Goldy knows prediction markets
- Content quality depends on deep market understanding
- Growth strategy needs someone who knows the PM community
- Trainer workflow should be designed for PM experts like Goldy
- His expertise = competitive advantage (not just tech)

### jmill (Technical Lead)
**Focus:** Implementation, infrastructure, video pipeline
**Time Commitment:** 10-30 hours/week (depending on option chosen)

**Responsibilities:**
- API endpoint development
- Dome/Polymarket integration
- Database updates
- Video pipeline (Eden API)
- Deployment and infrastructure
- Bug fixes and performance

**Specific Tasks:**
- [ ] Build market scanner API (Goldy defines filtering criteria)
- [ ] Update index.html with Dome data
- [ ] Create trainer interface (for Goldy to use)
- [ ] Test Eden API with Yeah LoRA
- [ ] Build video generation workflow
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs

**jmill ‚Üî Goldy Handoffs:**
- Goldy defines what markets to scan for ‚Üí jmill builds the filters
- jmill builds trainer UI ‚Üí Goldy tests and provides feedback
- Goldy writes thesis ‚Üí jmill generates video
- Video complete ‚Üí Goldy reviews quality and approves

### Parallel vs Sequential Work

**Can Do in Parallel (Week 1):**
- Seth: UI coordination ‚Üê ‚Üí jmill: Market scanner API ‚Üê ‚Üí Goldy: Market research
- Seth: Design approval ‚Üê ‚Üí jmill: Dome integration ‚Üê ‚Üí Goldy: Content strategy
- Seth: Social setup ‚Üê ‚Üí jmill: Database updates ‚Üê ‚Üí Goldy: Thesis development

**Must Do Sequentially (Week 2):**
1. jmill builds market scanner
2. Goldy tests scanner, selects first market
3. Goldy writes contrarian thesis + script
4. jmill generates video from script
5. Goldy reviews video quality
6. Seth approves and posts
7. All three monitor engagement

**Key Insight:** Goldy's domain expertise feeds into both Seth's strategy and jmill's implementation. He's the bridge between "what to build" and "how to use it."

## üé¨ Closing

**Key Message for Team:**
"We have all the technical pieces ready (Dome API, Polymarket, Eden, database). What we need now is Goldy's prediction market expertise to guide what we build and how it's used. The system is only as good as the market insights that drive it. This is a three-person team where each role is critical:
- **Seth:** Vision and coordination
- **Goldy:** Market expertise and content
- **jmill:** Technical execution

Pick a pace that works for everyone, and we'll adjust the timeline. Quality matters more than arbitrary dates."

**Recommended Approach:**
Start with **Option C (MVP)** - get one complete workflow working end-to-end, then iterate. With three people, we want fast feedback loops and clear handoffs. Build ‚Üí Test with Goldy ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Launch.

**Bottom Line:**
By end of month, we want: Real data dashboard + Market scanner + Goldy-selected opportunity + One video generated = Proof of concept working. Everything else is polish.

**Goldy's Impact:**
Without domain expertise, we're just building a generic prediction tool. With Goldy, we're building a system that leverages real PM knowledge = competitive advantage. His market selection and thesis development is what makes Miyomi's content credible and compelling.

---

**Meeting Prep Complete ‚úÖ**

Seth: Share this doc with both jmill and Goldy before the meeting. The three-person dynamic is key to success - technical excellence + market expertise + strategic vision.

**Suggested Meeting Format:**
1. Seth leads (vision/goals)
2. jmill explains technical options
3. Goldy weighs in on what markets/content strategy matters
4. All three decide on approach and timeline
5. Assign clear first tasks for each person

Good luck with the meeting! üöÄ
