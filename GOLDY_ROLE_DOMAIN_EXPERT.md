3. **Market Selection** - Can identify truly contrarian opportunities vs noise
4. **Thesis Development** - Craft arguments for why consensus is wrong
5. **Social/Growth Strategy** - Knows PM community, how to build audience, what platforms matter
6. **Partnership Insights** - May have contacts at Kalshi, Polymarket, or can advise on approach
7. **Real User Testing** - First trainer to test workflow, providing authentic feedback
