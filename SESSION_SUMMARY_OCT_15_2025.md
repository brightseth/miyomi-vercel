# Miyomi Session Summary - October 15, 2025

**Session Focus:** Beta Launch Planning & Competitive Analysis
**Duration:** Evening session
**Status:** Planning complete, ready to execute

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. Dome API Performance Tracking (✅ WORKING)
- **Built:** Live performance tracking demo at `/public/dome-tracking-demo.html`
- **Status:** Deployed and functional
- **Features:**
  - Real wallet tracking with Dome API
  - P&L calculation from order history
  - Win rate, trades count, markets traded
  - Interactive demo with sample wallet
- **URL:** https://miyomi-federation-bybizwlsx-edenprojects.vercel.app/dome-tracking-demo.html

**Key Finding:** Dome API order history endpoint is working! Other endpoints (market-price, candlesticks, wallet/pnl) still return 404, but we have a working fallback with `calculatePnLFromOrders()`.

### 2. Competitive Analysis (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Research:** Analyzed Polyfactual, PredictionSwap, Olas, Polytrader, Grok integrations
- **Document:** Created comprehensive `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` (15+ pages)
- **Key Insights:**
  - Everyone else building tools/bots (boring, commoditized)
  - Miyomi building personality/movement (unique, defensible)
  - Olas: 51% accuracy vs Miyomi's 65%+ target
  - No competitor offers public track record transparency
  - No competitor creates content or builds community

**8 Unfair Advantages Identified:**
1. Personality-First (entertainment value)
2. Public Track Record (Dome API transparency)
3. Education + Entertainment (teaching creates loyalty)
4. Proprietary Intelligence (Dome + Soup.xyz)
5. Attention Economy (revenue from virality)
6. Tokenized Community (75% revenue share)
7. Contrarian Positioning ("upstream" differentiation)
8. Cross-Platform (not dependent on single market)

### 3. About Page Updated (✅ DEPLOYED)
- **Changed:** Moved competitive analysis from index.html to about.html
- **Updated:** Tagline to "I teach you to be predictive, not predicted"
- **Added:** Complete competitive comparison section
- **Design:** Side-by-side "Everyone Else vs MIYOMI" layout
- **URL:** https://miyomi-federation-3zi8vc32v-edenprojects.vercel.app/about.html

### 4. Beta Launch Plan Created (✅ DOCUMENTED)
- **File:** `BETA_LAUNCH_PLAN.md` (25+ pages)
- **Scope:** Complete 2-week sprint plan to functional beta
- **Target:** October 29, 2025 (beta) → December 15, 2025 (token)

**Week 1 Plan (Oct 16-22):**
- Days 1-2: UI/UX redesign (remove all mock data)
- Days 3-4: Live data integration (Dome + Polymarket APIs)
- Days 5-7: Trainer workflow implementation (market scanner, queue, video request)

**Week 2 Plan (Oct 23-29):**
- Days 8-9: Video pipeline connection (Eden API testing)
- Days 10-11: Testing & refinement (with real data)
- Days 12-14: Beta launch (first real trade + video)

## 📊 Current Project Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Infrastructure:** 75% complete (Dome API, Supabase, Eden ready)
- **Documentation:** 100% complete (30k+ words across 16+ files)
- **Dome Tracking:** Live performance tracking functional
- **Competitive Position:** Clearly differentiated
- **Strategic Vision:** "Teaching prediction mastery" messaging

### ❌ Critical Gaps for Beta
1. **No Live Data** - Current UI is 100% mock/static
2. **Unclear Trainer Workflow** - No way to browse/select markets
3. **UI Not Production-Ready** - 30+ prototypes, none polished
4. **Missing Features** - Market scanner, video pipeline, social posting

### 🎯 Beta Success Criteria
- [ ] Public site shows real data (Dome API connected)
- [ ] Trainer can browse 50+ live Polymarket markets
- [ ] Opportunity scoring working (consensus detection)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow: market → video → post
- [ ] First real trade executed by Oct 29

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Defined

### Data Flow
```
Dome API → Performance Dashboard (public)
Polymarket API → Market Scanner (trainer)
Trainer Selection → AI Thesis Generation (Claude)
Thesis Approval → Video Request (Eden)
Video Complete → Social Post (Twitter/Farcaster)
```

### Key Endpoints to Build
- `GET /api/performance` - Dome PnL for public dashboard
- `GET /api/markets/scan` - Polymarket market scanner
- `POST /api/opportunities/add` - Add market to queue
- `POST /api/video/request` - Request Eden video
- `GET /api/video/status/:id` - Check video generation

### Files to Create
- `/public/trainer.html` - New trainer interface (complete workflow)
- `/api/markets/scan.js` - Polymarket market scanner
- `/api/opportunities/add.js` - Queue management
- Update `/public/index.html` - Remove mocks, connect Dome API

## 💡 Key Insights from Tonight

### Strategic
1. **Miyomi is fundamentally different** - Not a tool, a personality/movement
2. **Competitive moat is defensible** - No one else combining all 8 advantages
3. **"Upstream" positioning is powerful** - Teaching vs just trading
4. **Attention economy > trading profits** - More scalable, less risky

### Technical
1. **Dome API partially working** - Order history good, other endpoints coming
2. **Can calculate PnL from orders** - Don't need full API for beta
3. **Polymarket CLOB is accessible** - No auth needed for reading
4. **2 weeks is realistic** - Plan is achievable with focused execution

### Tactical
1. **Remove ALL mock data** - Must show real performance
2. **Trainer needs clear workflow** - Browse → select → create → post
3. **Start with high-confidence picks** - Build credibility early
4. **Test extensively Week 2** - No surprises at launch
