## Comparison: Old vs New Timeline

### OLD (Before Dome API):
- Week 1: Database + Polymarket/Kalshi APIs (had issues)
- Week 2: Video pipeline (blocked by bad opportunity data)
- Week 3: First test (likely to fail, poor signals)

### NEW (With Dome API):
- Week 1: Database ‚úÖ + Get Dome key
- Week 2: Dome integration (5 days, solves API issues)
- Week 3: Video pipeline (with real high-confidence opportunities)
- Week 4: First real content (better quality from better data)

**Result:** +1 week delay for Dome integration, but MUCH higher quality output and success probability.

---

## Bottom Line

**Trade-off:** Adding 5 days for Dome integration now saves weeks of debugging bad APIs and improves win rate significantly.

**Launch Target:** Mid-December 2025 - STILL ACHIEVABLE

**Critical Path:** Dome API key ‚Üí 5-day integration ‚Üí Video pipeline ‚Üí Trading phase ‚Üí Token launch

**Next 48 Hours:** Follow up on Dome API key daily, prepare for rapid integration once received.

**Confidence:** HIGH (with Dome API solving major blockers)
