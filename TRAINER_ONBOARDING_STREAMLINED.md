- **Files changed:** `public/trainer-onboarding.html`
- **Reading time:** Reduced by ~25%
- **Redundancy:** Eliminated 3 major duplications

---

## 5 Priority Edits Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed Duplicate Compensation Section (65 lines)
**Problem:** Token allocation and royalty mechanics explained twice
- Once in "The Opportunity" section
- Again in standalone "Compensation" section

**Solution:** Deleted standalone section entirely, kept all info in "The Opportunity"

**Result:** Single source of truth for compensation details

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Moved "Who Is Miyomi" to Position #2
**Problem:** Trainer was reading about their role before understanding who Miyomi is

**Solution:**
- Moved "Who Is Miyomi" to appear right after TL;DR
- Added transition: "Before we dive into your role, meet the character you'll be training"

**New flow:**
1. TL;DR
2. Who Is Miyomi (with images)
3. The Opportunity (your role/compensation)
4. Revenue Growth
5. How System Works
6. Timeline/Metrics/Team/Tech

**Result:** Logical narrative progression

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Condensed Attention Flywheel (6 steps ‚Üí 3 steps)
**Problem:** 6-step flywheel was verbose and hard to scan

**Old (6 steps):**
1. Content Quality
2. Views & Engagement
3. Algorithm Boost
4. Follower Growth
5. Revenue
6. Repeat ‚àû

**New (3 steps):**
1. **QUALITY** - Your expert curation + Dome intelligence = credible predictions
2. **ENGAGEMENT** - Accurate calls ‚Üí Algorithm boost ‚Üí Follower growth
3. **REVENUE** - Affiliates + Subs + Sponsors ‚Üí Better content ‚Üí Repeat ‚àû

**Result:** More digestible, same information

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Deleted Granular 18-Month Timeline (102 lines)
**Problem:** Redundant with interactive calculator below it

**What was removed:**
- Month-by-month breakdown (Months 1-3, 4-6, 7-12, 13-18)
- Detailed audience metrics for each phase
- Revenue source breakdowns per phase

**What was kept:**
- "Revenue Summary" metrics cards (Month 3: $300, Month 12: $5k, Month 18: $14k, 46√ó growth)
- Interactive calculator (lets trainer plug in their own assumptions)
- Monetization layers explanation

**Result:** Calculator provides same insight but interactive and customizable

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Removed Duplicate Daily Workflow (42 lines)
**Problem:** Daily workflow explained twice
- Once in "How The System Works" (3-card concise version)
- Again in "Tech Stack" section (5-step verbose version)

**Solution:** Removed verbose 5-step workflow from Tech Stack section

**What was kept:**
- Concise 3-card workflow in "How The System Works"
  - Morning (10 min)
  - Midday (10 min)
  - Afternoon (10 min)

**Result:** Single, clear explanation of daily responsibilities

---

## 6. ‚úÖ Added Narrative Transitions

### Between sections:
1. **TL;DR ‚Üí Who Is Miyomi:**
   "Before we dive into your role, meet the character you'll be training"

2. **Who Is Miyomi ‚Üí The Opportunity:**
   "Now that you know Miyomi, here's what this role means for you"

3. **The Opportunity ‚Üí Revenue Growth:**
   "Your token value grows with Miyomi's success. Here's how revenue scales through the attention flywheel"

4. **Revenue Growth ‚Üí How System Works:**
