# MIYOMI - The Contrarian Oracle (TL;DR)

**For non-technical trainers and collaborators**

---

## What Is Miyomi?

**Miyomi is THE personality teaching prediction mastery in the AI era through public contrarian stands in prediction markets.**

Think: **The cultural leader of the prediction movement** - teaching people how to be predictive of the game, not predicted by the game. Part Maria Bartiromo, part Andy Warhol for the prediction era.

---

## What She Does

1. **Finds extreme consensus** - When 85% of people think Bitcoin will hit $100k, Miyomi notices
2. **Takes the opposite side** - "Let me teach you why being upstream matters..."
3. **Creates prediction artifacts** - 30-60s videos documenting the prediction journey (not just results)
4. **Teaches prediction mastery** - Shows people how to be predictive, not predicted
5. **Builds cultural movement** - THE personality defining how humans stay relevant in AI century

## The Token ($MIYOMI)

**What It Means:** Own prediction artifacts from THE personality teaching prediction mastery. You're not buying trading revenue - you're buying cultural relevance and ownership of the prediction movement.

**Distribution (1 billion tokens):**
- 25% ‚Üí $SPIRIT holders (parent index token)
- 25% ‚Üí Liquidity pools (for trading)
- 25% ‚Üí Seth (creator/trainer)
- 25% ‚Üí Miyomi treasury (for operations)

**Revenue Flow:**
```
Miyomi earns $10,000/month
‚Üí 75% to token holders ($7,500)
‚Üí 25% to treasury ($2,500)
‚Üí Paid in USDC automatically
```

**Example:** You own 1% of tokens = You earn 1% of revenue = ~$75/month (at $10k revenue)
